# SatCheck - network monitor.
A C# .NET (mvvm) application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that stores data in a SQLite database and displays the status of hosts using live charts. The application also includes the ability to generate simple reports and save them as PDF files. In addition to these features, the application includes a few useful networking and radio communication units calculators. This tool can be useful for monitoring the status of hosts in a network.
